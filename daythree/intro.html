        <p>
            Hi, my name is <b>Sahil Pawar</b>I am a current student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering from the MET Institute of Engineering in Nashik. 
            I completed a one-month internship at Sparks Foundation, where I gained hands-on experience in the field. 
            I have a good understanding of multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, and C++, and I'm currently pursuing Core Java training from TNS Foundation India to enhance my skills further. I am a quick learner, adaptable, and I believe in being diligent in my work. Outside of academics, my hobbies include sketching and playing cricket.
